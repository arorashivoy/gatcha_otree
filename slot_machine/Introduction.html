    <h1>Welcome to the Gacha Game Experiment!</h1>
    
    <p>In this experiment, you will be participating in a Gacha-style game, similar to those found in mobile games like *Honkai Star Rail* (HSR). Gacha games involve spending in-game currency to receive random rewards, which could be valuable items or characters.</p>
    
    <p>Your starting balance for the experiment is <strong>{{ initial_money }} in-game currency</strong>. Each time you want to make a pull in the Gacha game, it will cost you <strong>{{ cost_per_spin }} in-game currency</strong>. Your goal is to manage your currency wisely and make the best pulls to maximize your rewards!</p>

    <p>Once you have read this information, click the button below to start the game and make your first pull!</p>

    <button id="start-game-btn" onclick="startGame()">Start Game</button>

    <p><em>Note: You will not lose real money or resources in this experiment, it's all simulated using in-game currency!</em></p>

    <script>
        function startGame() {
            liveSend({start_game: true});
        }
